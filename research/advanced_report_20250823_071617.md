# Advanced Statistical Validation Report
## CoT SafePath Filter Enhancement Study

### Executive Summary

This comprehensive statistical validation evaluated enhanced CoT filtering on 500 test cases using advanced statistical methods including bootstrap confidence intervals, cross-validation, effect size analysis, and reproducibility testing.

### Key Statistical Findings

- **Bootstrap 95% Confidence Interval**: [0.0220, 0.0520]
- **Bootstrap 99% Confidence Interval**: [0.0180, 0.0540]
- **Effect Size (Cohen's d)**: 0.0741 (negligible)
- **Statistical Power**: 0.458
- **Cross-Validation Accuracy**: 0.636 ± 0.034
- **Reproducibility Score**: 1.000

### Statistical Significance Assessment

✅ **Bootstrap Analysis**: 95% confidence interval excludes zero - statistically significant improvement
❌ **Wilcoxon Test**: p = 0.200 - not statistically significant
✅ **McNemar Test**: p = 0.001 - statistically significant

### Effect Size Analysis

**Cohen's d = 0.0741**

The improvement is negligible with no practical significance.

### Statistical Power Analysis

⚠️ **Insufficient Power**: 0.458 (< 0.80 target)
**Recommendation**: Increase sample size to 2852 for adequate power.

### Cross-Validation Results

**5-Fold Cross-Validation Accuracy**: 0.636 ± 0.034
**95% Confidence Interval**: [0.606, 0.666]
✅ **Stable Performance**: Low standard deviation indicates consistent results across folds

### Reproducibility Assessment

✅ **Highly Reproducible**: Score = 1.000
Multiple runs with different random seeds show consistent results, indicating stable algorithmic performance.

### Dataset Composition

**Content Categories:**
- deceptive_reasoning: 40 cases (8.0%)
- direct_harmful: 40 cases (8.0%)
- multi_step_planning: 40 cases (8.0%)
- obfuscated_harmful: 40 cases (8.0%)
- prompt_injection: 40 cases (8.0%)
- safe: 300 cases (60.0%)

### Statistical Methodology

**Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: Non-parametric resampling with 500 iterations
**Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation
**Effect Size**: Cohen's d for standardized mean difference
**Power Analysis**: Post-hoc power calculation for observed effect size
**Reproducibility**: 10 independent runs with different random seeds
**Non-parametric Tests**: Wilcoxon signed-rank test and McNemar test for paired data

### Conclusions and Recommendations

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **Statistically Significant Improvement**

The enhanced CoT filtering approach demonstrates statistically significant improvements over the baseline across multiple statistical tests. 
The effect size is negligible, suggesting limited practical benefit.

**Recommendation for Future Studies**: Increase sample size to approximately 2852 cases to achieve adequate statistical power (≥ 0.80).

The high reproducibility score indicates that results are stable and reliable across different experimental conditions.
