### Threat Model

Our threat model considers the following attack vectors:

1. **Bypass Attempts**: Attempts to circumvent filtering mechanisms
2. **Prompt Injection**: Malicious prompts designed to manipulate filtering
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Attempts to extract sensitive information
4. **DoS Attacks**: Attempts to overwhelm the filtering system
5. **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies or build processes
