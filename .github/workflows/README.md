# GitHub Actions Workflows

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: You need to manually create these GitHub Actions workflows yourself.**

This directory contains template GitHub Actions workflows for the CoT SafePath Filter project. Since automated tools cannot directly modify GitHub workflows, you'll need to create these files manually in your repository.

## Required Workflows

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci-cd.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Continuous integration and deployment
- **Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests
- **Features**: 
  - Code quality checks (lint, format, type-check)
  - Security scanning (CodeQL, Snyk, Bandit)
  - Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, security)
  - Build verification and artifact creation
  - Automated deployment to staging/production

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security analysis
- **Triggers**: Schedule (daily), pull requests touching security-sensitive files
- **Features**:
  - SAST with CodeQL and Semgrep
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Container security scanning
  - Secrets detection
  - SBOM generation

### 3. Release Management (`release.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated release process
- **Triggers**: Release tags (v*)
- **Features**:
  - Semantic versioning
  - Automated changelog generation
  - Package publishing to PyPI
  - Docker image publishing
  - GitHub release creation

### 4. Performance Testing (`performance.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Performance regression testing
- **Triggers**: Schedule (weekly), manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Benchmark execution
  - Performance regression detection
  - Load testing with realistic scenarios
  - Memory and CPU profiling

### 5. Documentation (`docs.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Documentation building and deployment
- **Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests affecting docs
- **Features**:
  - Documentation building with MkDocs
  - API documentation generation
  - Deployment to GitHub Pages
  - Link validation

## Template Files Available

Each workflow template includes:
- Complete YAML configuration
- Detailed comments explaining each step
- Security best practices
- Parallel job execution for performance
- Artifact management
- Notification integration

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create workflow files**: Copy the template content from the documentation into new `.yml` files in `.github/workflows/`

2. **Configure secrets**: Add required secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `PYPI_TOKEN` - For package publishing
   - `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN` - For container registry
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For coverage reporting
   - `SNYK_TOKEN` - For security scanning

3. **Configure branch protection**: Set up required status checks for the main branch

4. **Review and customize**: Adapt the workflows to your specific needs and environment

## Example Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      # ... additional steps
```

## Security Considerations

- All workflows use pinned action versions
- Secrets are properly scoped and protected
- Build artifacts are signed and verified
- Dependencies are automatically updated with Dependabot
- Security scanning runs on every change

## Monitoring and Alerting

The workflows include integration with:
- Slack/Discord for notifications
- Email alerts for failures
- Dashboard updates for metrics
- Automatic issue creation for failures
