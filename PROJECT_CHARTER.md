# CoT SafePath Filter - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

The CoT SafePath Filter project delivers a real-time middleware system that intercepts and sanitizes chain-of-thought reasoning from AI systems to prevent harmful or deceptive reasoning patterns from reaching end users. This defensive AI safety tool addresses the critical need for transparent AI reasoning validation in high-stakes applications.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenge
Modern AI systems, particularly large language models, can generate sophisticated chain-of-thought reasoning that may contain:
- Deceptive reasoning patterns designed to manipulate users
- Harmful planning sequences for dangerous activities  
- Capability concealment where models hide their true capabilities
- Gradual manipulation techniques that build trust before introducing harmful content

### Business Impact
Without proper filtering, these reasoning patterns pose significant risks:
- **Legal Liability**: Organizations deploying unfiltered AI reasoning face potential legal consequences
- **Reputation Risk**: Public exposure of harmful AI outputs can damage brand trust
- **Security Risk**: Malicious reasoning patterns could be used for social engineering or planning attacks
- **Compliance Risk**: Unfiltered AI systems may violate emerging AI safety regulations

## Project Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Safety Assurance**: Achieve >99% detection rate for known harmful reasoning patterns
2. **Performance Excellence**: Maintain <50ms P95 latency for real-time filtering operations
3. **Integration Simplicity**: Provide seamless integration with major LLM frameworks (LangChain, OpenAI, AutoGen)
4. **Operational Reliability**: Deliver 99.9% uptime with comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### Secondary Goals
1. **Adaptive Learning**: Implement feedback mechanisms to improve detection over time
2. **Multi-Modal Support**: Extend filtering capabilities to image and audio reasoning chains
3. **Enterprise Scalability**: Support 10,000+ concurrent filtering operations
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Align with emerging AI safety standards and frameworks

## Success Criteria
