# SafePath Filter Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: SafePath Filter  
**Project Lead**: Daniel Schmidt (safety@terragonlabs.com)  
**Start Date**: January 2025  
**Initial Release Target**: Q2 2025  

## Problem Statement

As AI systems become more sophisticated and widely deployed, there is a critical need to prevent harmful, deceptive, or dangerous reasoning patterns from reaching end users. Current AI safety measures focus primarily on input/output filtering but fail to address the chain-of-thought reasoning process where truly dangerous planning and deception can occur.

The SafePath Filter addresses this gap by providing real-time middleware that intercepts and sanitizes chain-of-thought reasoning to prevent harmful patterns from leaving the AI sandbox.

## Project Mission

To provide enterprise-grade, real-time filtering of AI chain-of-thought reasoning that prevents harmful or deceptive patterns from reaching end users while maintaining system performance and usability.

## Scope and Objectives

### In Scope

#### Core Functionality
- ✅ Real-time chain-of-thought reasoning analysis and filtering
- ✅ Multi-level filtering pipeline (token, pattern, semantic)
- ✅ Harmful pattern detection (deception, manipulation, dangerous planning)
- ✅ Integration with major LLM frameworks (LangChain, OpenAI, AutoGen)
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring
- ✅ High-performance API with <50ms latency requirements

#### Security & Compliance
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trails
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Compliance with major security standards (SOC2, GDPR)
- ✅ Vulnerability scanning and security testing

#### Deployment & Operations
- ✅ Container-based deployment (Docker/Kubernetes)
- ✅ Cloud-native architecture with horizontal scaling
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- ✅ Documentation and developer tools

### Out of Scope (v1.0)
