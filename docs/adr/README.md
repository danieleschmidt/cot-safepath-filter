# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the CoT SafePath Filter project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

We use the format proposed by Michael Nygard in his article "[Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)".

Each ADR should include:

1. **Title**: Short noun phrase
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context**: Forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local
4. **Decision**: Response to these forces
5. **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult
