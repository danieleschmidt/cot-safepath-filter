# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

Date: 2025-01-27
Status: Accepted

## Context

We need to select a technology stack for the SafePath Filter that balances performance, maintainability, security, and developer productivity while meeting our latency requirements (<50ms) and scalability targets (10k+ RPS).

## Decision

We have chosen the following technology stack:

### Backend Framework
- **FastAPI** for the web framework
- **Python 3.9+** as the primary language
- **Pydantic** for data validation and serialization
- **SQLAlchemy** for database ORM

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL** for primary data storage
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Alembic** for database migrations

### Machine Learning
- **PyTorch** for deep learning models
- **Transformers** (HuggingFace) for NLP models
- **scikit-learn** for traditional ML algorithms
- **NumPy/Pandas** for data processing

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- **Prometheus** for metrics
- **Grafana** for visualization

### Development Tools
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **MyPy** for type checking
- **Pytest** for testing
- **Ruff** for linting
- **Pre-commit** for git hooks

## Consequences

### Positive
- FastAPI provides excellent async performance and automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Python ecosystem has rich ML/AI libraries and strong community
- PostgreSQL offers ACID compliance and excellent JSON support
- Redis provides sub-millisecond caching performance
- Docker/Kubernetes enable cloud-native deployment patterns

### Negative
- Python's GIL may limit CPU-bound operations (mitigated by async I/O)
- Need to carefully manage ML model memory usage
- Additional complexity from microservices architecture

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Python performance bottlenecks
  - **Mitigation**: Use async/await, Cython for critical paths, proper profiling
- **Risk**: ML model inference latency
  - **Mitigation**: Model optimization, caching, batch inference where possible
- **Risk**: Database connection pooling issues
  - **Mitigation**: Proper connection pool configuration, monitoring
