# Workflow Requirements Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the GitHub Actions workflows required for comprehensive SDLC automation.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated testing, linting, and security checks
- **Triggers**: Push to main, PRs, scheduled runs
- **Required Steps**:
  - Multi-Python version testing (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
  - Code quality checks (Black, Ruff, MyPy)
  - Security scanning (Bandit, Safety, Secret detection)
  - Test coverage reporting
  - Docker image building and testing

### 2. Release Management (`release.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated releases and deployments
- **Triggers**: Version tags, release creation
- **Required Steps**:
  - PyPI package publishing
  - Docker image publishing to registry
  - GitHub release notes generation
  - Documentation deployment

### 3. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security analysis
- **Triggers**: Schedule (daily), security events
- **Required Steps**:
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
  - Container image vulnerability scanning
  - License compliance checking

### 4. Performance Testing (`performance.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Performance regression detection
- **Triggers**: PRs to main, scheduled runs
- **Required Steps**:
  - Load testing with realistic scenarios
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Memory usage analysis
  - Latency measurement and reporting

## Manual Setup Required

⚠️ **Important**: GitHub Actions workflows require manual creation due to permission limitations.

Please create the following files in `.github/workflows/`:
- `ci.yml` - See [GitHub Actions CI/CD Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests)
- `release.yml` - See [Release Automation Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages)
- `security.yml` - See [Security Scanning Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning)
- `performance.yml` - Custom performance testing workflow

## Repository Settings

Configure the following repository settings manually:
- **Branch Protection**: Require status checks for main branch
- **Security**: Enable vulnerability alerts and security updates
- **Actions**: Configure workflow permissions and secrets
- **Pages**: Enable GitHub Pages for documentation (if needed)
