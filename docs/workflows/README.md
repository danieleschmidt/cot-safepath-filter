# CI/CD Workflows Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation and templates for GitHub Actions workflows that need to be manually created by repository maintainers due to GitHub App permission limitations.

## Overview

The CoT SafePath Filter requires several CI/CD workflows to ensure code quality, security, and reliable deployments. This documentation provides templates and configuration guides for implementing these workflows.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI) - `ci.yml`
**Purpose**: Validate all pull requests and commits
**Triggers**: Pull requests, pushes to main branch
**Location**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### 2. Continuous Deployment (CD) - `cd.yml`
**Purpose**: Deploy to staging and production environments
**Triggers**: Pushes to main branch, release tags
**Location**: `.github/workflows/cd.yml`

### 3. Security Scanning - `security-scan.yml`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security analysis
**Triggers**: Schedule (daily), pull requests
**Location**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

### 4. Dependency Updates - `dependency-update.yml`
**Purpose**: Automated dependency management
**Triggers**: Schedule (weekly)
**Location**: `.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml`

### 5. Release Management - `release.yml`
**Purpose**: Automated release process
**Triggers**: Release creation
**Location**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Workflow Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### Step 2: Copy Templates
Copy the workflow templates from `docs/workflows/examples/` to `.github/workflows/`

### Step 3: Configure Secrets
Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

#### Required Secrets
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN`: Token for Docker registry access
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Slack webhook for notifications
- `PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY`: PagerDuty routing key for alerts
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Codecov token for coverage reporting
- `SONAR_TOKEN`: SonarCloud token for code analysis

#### Optional Secrets
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key for cloud deployments
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key for cloud deployments
- `HEROKU_API_KEY`: Heroku API key for Heroku deployments
- `NPM_TOKEN`: NPM token for package publishing

### Step 4: Configure Branch Protection
Set up branch protection rules for the main branch:
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require review from code owners
- Restrict pushes to matching branches

### Step 5: Set up Environments
Create the following environments in GitHub:
- `development`: For development deployments
- `staging`: For staging deployments
- `production`: For production deployments (with approval required)

## Manual Setup Required

⚠️ **Important**: Due to GitHub App permission limitations, repository maintainers must manually create workflow files using the templates provided in the `examples/` directory.
