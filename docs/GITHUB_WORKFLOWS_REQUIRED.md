# Required GitHub Workflows Setup

> **Note**: This repository requires GitHub Actions workflows to be set up manually by a repository administrator, as automated workflow creation is restricted for security reasons.

## Required Workflow Files

The following workflow files need to be created in `.github/workflows/`:

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with testing, security scanning, and deployment
**Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests, releases

**Key Features**:
- Multi-Python version testing (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, security, performance)
- Security scanning (Bandit, Safety, Semgrep, Container scanning)
- Code quality checks (Black, Ruff, MyPy, coverage)
- Docker image building and security scanning
- Automated deployment on successful tests

**Required Secrets**:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` (for releases)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (for notifications)

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Dedicated security scanning and vulnerability assessment
**Triggers**: Schedule (daily), manual dispatch

**Key Features**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Container image scanning
- Secret detection
- License compliance check
- Security reporting and notifications

### 3. Performance Testing (`performance.yml`)

**Purpose**: Performance benchmarking and regression detection
**Triggers**: Schedule (weekly), release

**Key Features**:
- Load testing with baseline comparison
- Memory usage profiling
- Response time monitoring
- Performance regression detection
- Benchmark result archiving

### 4. Release Automation (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated release process
**Triggers**: Release creation, version tags

**Key Features**:
- Version validation and bumping
- Changelog generation
- PyPI publishing
- Docker image tagging and publishing
- GitHub release creation with artifacts
- Notification to stakeholders

### 5. Dependency Updates (`dependabot-auto-merge.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated dependency management
**Triggers**: Dependabot PRs

**Key Features**:
- Automated testing of dependency updates
- Security-focused dependency prioritization
- Auto-merge of minor/patch updates after testing
- Manual review requirement for major updates

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: `ci.yml` - Essential for development workflow
2. **High Priority**: `security.yml` - Critical for AI safety project
3. **Medium Priority**: `release.yml` - Needed for deployment automation
4. **Medium Priority**: `performance.yml` - Important for performance tracking
5. **Low Priority**: `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` - Nice to have automation

## Setup Instructions

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory in repository root
2. Add each workflow file with appropriate configuration
3. Configure required secrets in repository settings
4. Test workflows with draft PRs before enabling
5. Monitor workflow runs and adjust as needed

## Integration Points

- **Monitoring**: Workflows integrate with Prometheus/Grafana for metrics
- **Security**: Results feed into security dashboards and alerting
- **Performance**: Benchmarks stored for trend analysis
- **Notifications**: Slack/email notifications for failures and releases

## Compliance and Security

- All workflows follow security best practices
- Secrets are properly scoped and rotated
- Audit trails maintained for all automated actions
- Security scanning includes supply chain analysis

## Manual Setup Required

Repository administrators need to:
1. Create workflow files manually
2. Configure repository secrets
3. Set up branch protection rules
4. Configure notifications and integrations
5. Test and validate workflow functionality

This setup will complete the CI/CD automation gap identified in the repository metrics.
